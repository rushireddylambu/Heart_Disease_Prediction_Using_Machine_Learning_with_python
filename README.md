In this project i focused on heart disease prediction in patients using machine learning algorithms such as naive bayes, random forest, multi layer perceptron and support vector machine.

The dataset that i have used also consists of some extra health checkup details that were added by me. The dataset contains a total of 3000 instances with 14 attributes.

After working with all the four algorithms i found out Random forest algorithm achieved highest accuracy in prediting the heart disease in patients.
